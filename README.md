Store App
This is a front-end application designed to allow any store to generate a URL with formatted JSON products. Users can load and view these products using the generated URL, as well as create their own products by uploading images from the web or their device gallery. The primary objective is to eliminate the need for a private application for showcasing store products. In addition to viewing and adding products to the cart, users can also edit existing products and view past orders.

Features
Product Display:

The app allows users to load and view products from a URL containing formatted JSON content.
Users can browse through different products offered by the store.
Each product is displayed with essential details such as image, name, and price.
Product Management:

Users have the ability to create their own products.
Product creation involves uploading an image, providing a name, and specifying the price.
Users can edit the name and price of existing products to correct and refine the information.
Cart Functionality:

Users can remove products from the cart if needed.
Order Placement:

Once users have added products to their cart, they can proceed to place an order.
A "Buy" button allows users to finalize their purchase and generate an order.
Order history is maintained for users to review their past purchases.
Backend Configuration
To use the Store App, you need to configure the backend methods responsible for handling data storage, retrieval, and order processing. The app assumes the use of Firebase as the backend service, but you should replace the placeholder code with your own Firebase configurations and API keys.

Create a Firebase project:

Go to the Firebase Console and create a new project.
Enable the necessary Firebase services such as Firestore for data storage and Firebase Authentication for user management.
Configure Firebase in the app:

In the project codebase, locate the Firebase configuration file (e.g., firebaseConfig.js).
Replace the placeholder values with your Firebase project's configuration details.
Ensure the app is connected to your Firebase project by verifying the configuration.
Implement backend methods:

Create the necessary backend methods or APIs to handle product storage, retrieval, and order processing.
These methods should interact with the Firebase services and database to perform the required operations.
Replace the placeholder backend method calls in the app with your own implementation.
